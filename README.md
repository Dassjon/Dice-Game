# Dice-Game

Players roll the dice to earn points. Depending on the number on the dice, they will get more or fewer points. 

They can roll as many times as they want to accumulate a high score, but be careful! If the dice lands on 1, then all accumulated points will be reset.

After players did press the hold button, the current turns to the next player. 

The first player to reach out on 50pts wins!
